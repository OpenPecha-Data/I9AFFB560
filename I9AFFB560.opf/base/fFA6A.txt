Divine Blue Water
A Contamination-Purifying1 Smoke Offering
by the Great Master Padmasambhava
edited by Dudjom Rinpoche Jikdral Yeshé Dorjé

Padmasambhavāya namaḥ!
When the master Padmsambhava was practicing at Samyé Chimpu cave, King Tri Songdetsen had been
unwell for a long time. Throughout the land there was famine, blight, frost, and hail,
along with epidemics and many other unsettling omens. After much discussion, the ministers
called the necessary experts—a doctor, a diviner, and an astrologer. The doctor checked the
king’s pulse and said, “This illness does not have the pulse indicating imbalance of the
four elemental dynamics. Because the pulse is sunken and clouded, it appears to be an affliction
of uncleanliness.” After this, the diviner performed a divination and the astrologer
made calculations. They all agreed that the king and the local deities had become agitated
by some unclean infection contamination, but neither doctor nor diviner nor astrologer,
nor anyone else, had any idea what causes and conditions had brought about the contamination.
Meanwhile, King Tri Songdetsen’s queen, Mongza Tricham had given birth to a child of unsightly
affliction.2 The queen secretly handed the baby over to a servant woman, saying: “It is
of the upmost importance that you hide this without anyone seeing you.” The servant buried
the baby in the ground. Because the baby’s body came into contact with the belly of the
earth deity who ruled over that place, the landowner and all the local deities were struck
down by unclean contamination, all falling sick. Hence, the king and his realm were all now
afflicted.
The servant woman also fell ill—infected by the contamination. She developed debilitating arthritis
in her head and limbs. A doctor was called and consulted. “This is not a disease of
the four elemental dynamics,” he said. “You have been struck by some unclean infection contamination,
but I don’t know what type of contamination this is and so I have no means to
treat your illness.” At this point, the servant explained how she had hidden the queen’s
baby. The story spread from one person to another until it reached the king’s ear. The king
called Tricham and asked her about it. Tricham thought, “This will put the servant woman’s
life in danger,” so she did not tell her husband the truth. The king was angry and thought
to punish Tricham, but she went to the precious Guru of Uḍḍiyāna to beg for protection.
The Guru wrote a letter to the king and had it delivered, along with a blessed knot:
“It seems you are thinking of punishing Queen Tricham. However, I am a yogi who realizes that
appearances are not real. Because I know that all these various appearances arise through
dependent origination, I have the power to eliminate not only this unclean infection contamination,
but also the contamination of the mental afflictions—the five poisons. I have
a purification method that is easy to perform, of few words and great benefit. Please now
gather together all the substances and equipment that you will need. Do not worry, King. Come
tomorrow with your ministers and retinue to the summit of Samyé Hepo Ri.”
The king was very pleased. He gathered the substances and equipment, and the next day he climbed
to the top of Mount Hepo Ri. The great master was there. He took all the substances that
the king had brought, put them into a large, spacious container, and as they burned, he
recited this liturgy:

Having spoken thus, he said: “King, ministers, and retinue—have no doubt! It is beneficial to
practice this.”
Then they rejoiced—king, ministers, and retinue, feeling pleased and happy. Offering a mandala
of gold, they prostrated, circumambulated, and said: “Kyé! Great master, how do we continue
to practice this, and for what purpose?”
The great master said: “Kyé! Great King, you must do something meaningful with this human body
that you have obtained, which has the freedoms and advantages. The way to do this is to
create the causes for awakening by supplicating the worldly and world-transcending deities
and guardians.
“If you do this, they will clear away obstacles and circumstances that impede awakening, and
they will create the proper circumstances for both sublime and common spiritual accomplishment.
This is why you must serve the deities and guardians.
“Making purifying smoke offerings will purify the contamination from the pollution of the mental
afflictions, the five poisons, and it is a method for surrounding yourself with deities
and guardians so that they will never be separate from you. This is the purpose of continually
making purifying smoke offerings.
“In particular, the method for quickly eliminating impurity and contamination pollution is to
make purifying smoke offerings to the deities in the morning, and to follow this with the
contamination-purifying smoke offering and the contamination-cleansing ceremony in the evening.
If you do this, all pollution and impurity will be dispelled. The deities and guardians
will surround you. You will be blessed with food, wealth, and luxury. The body’s elemental
dynamics will be in balance. You will be glowing and radiant. Your constitution and
senses will be bright. You will be pleasing to everyone. The worldly gods and spirits will
obey you. You will not be sullied by the stains of obstacles and adverse circumstances,
and you will be endowed with many good qualities.”
The king said: “Very good, Great Master! How does one perform the contamination-cleansing ceremony?”
The great master said: “The traditions of Sūtra and Tantra each have their own particular contamination-cleansing
ceremonies. There are many different ingredients, preparations and so
on. However, in this case, the medicinal substances and aromatics already mentioned should
be mixed with clean water and poured into a precious vase. Sprinkle the water in all directions;
this is the cleansing of the place. Also, by this method, you can cleanse the representations
of wisdom form, speech, and heart; this is the cleansing of representations.
“If disease spreads among humans, livestock and so forth, cleanse the contamination pollution
while identifying with the fury of Vajravidāraṇa, wrathful Ucchuṣma, Amṛtakuṇḍalī and so
on. If wealth substances are polluted, it is sufficient to sprinkle the cleansing water on
them.”
Pleased, the great king reverently joined his palms and did many prostrations and circumambulations.
Then he returned to the palace. It wasn’t long before the king’s illness passed and
there were many auspicious omens in the regions of Tibet.
Here ends the text called Divine Blue Water: The Contamination-Purifying Smoke Offering Performed
by The Great Master Padmasambhava.
This contamination-purifying smoke offering and the purifying smoke offering called The Source
of Bounty and Happiness were not hidden as treasures. They were painted on the outer wall
of Pehar Kordzöling, and thus are known as the Samyé mural. From there, the textual lineage
spread widely in Ü and Tsang. In particular, the master Vairocana took the text with
him when he went to Gyalmo Tsawarong. On the way, in Kham, he gave it to Diri Chökyi Dragpa.
Since then, the lineage has spread and flourished throughout Kham until the present day.
Sarva Maṅgalam.
Many village mantrikas, both learned and uneducated, have passed on this textual lineage by
reciting it and writing it out by hand. Thus, there are slight variations in the wording of
different versions. Using a few correct texts as a basis, I, Jikdrel Yeshé Dorjé, have attempted
to carefully edit this so as to increase the number of good copies. May it bring
goodness!

↑ The word contamination (mnol; grib; mnol grib) throughout this text can refer to toxins, pathogens,
pollutants and other forms of impurities that infect, contaminate and defile the
body and mind of the individual. Purification (bsang) refers to the cleansing or transforming
of these entities.↑ The child is called a rtsog mnöl gyi bu. According to Lama Dawa Chödak,
this implies that the child was fathered by someone other than the king, probably someone
of a low caste.↑ Whites and reds (dkar dmar) refers to the three whites (milk, yogurt
and butter), three sweets (honey, molasses and white sugar) and three reds (flesh, blood
and bones) as given in burnt offerings.↑ According to Lama Dawa Chödak, phrag lha is a
deity of bravery.↑ This is the infected heartwood of Aquilaria sinensis; this infected part
is referred to as agarwood (a gar u).↑ The Tibetan word “gser shing” is another name for
berberis.↑ The three fruits comprise chebulic myrobalan, beleric myrobalan and Indian gooseberry;
the six excellences comprise nutmeg, cloves, bamboo pith, saffron, white cardamom,
black cardamom.↑ According to Lama Dawa Chödak, the Organs offered in sur (gsur) are the
heart, tongue, nose, eyes, and ears.↑ According to Lama Dawa Chödak, the white and red
samaya substances are semen and menstrual blood.↑ Guggül (gu gul) refers to black and white
varieties of mukul myrrh. Black is Commiphora mukul, white is Boswellia serrata.↑ Malha
Budzi (ma lha bu rdzi) is a particular warrior deity that Divine Blue Water mentions twice.
She also features in a text from the Kagyü school, which describes her as “a golden-colored
woman, who holds a spindle and a coil of thread. She is the goddess of maternity, who
influences the birth of children.”↑ Alternative prints of this text have b(h)alabhadri/dra
variations on the term’s spelling, which have varying identifications. If balabhadra, this
is a synonym for trāyamāṇā, a type of gentian (Gentiana kurroo) used to treat fevers and
vitiation of blood or Lodhra (Symplocos racemosa), a type of shrub used in Ayurveda to treat
women. If bhaladhāra, this most likely refers to menstrual blood or ox flesh.
